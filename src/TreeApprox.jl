#We start with a predefined tree. We already known the bushiness of the treee, number of stages in the tree, height of the tree,
#leaves in the tree, nodes of the tree e.t.c. The tree we start with is just random and is not good for stochastic approximation.
#Therefore, we take a path, either GaussianSamplePath or RunningMaximum and a number of scenarios and then try to improve this tree using the simulated path.
#The function Stochastic approximation tree takes a path, newtree, samplesize, pNorm and Wassertein parameter.
