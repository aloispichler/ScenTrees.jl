It turns out that having a bushy branching structure produces a scenario tree that has a better approximation quality than a tree with less bushy branching structure. Also, the height of the tree plays a big role on the approximation quality of the scenario tree. Higher trees have a better approximation quality than shorter trees. If we combine these two factors (bushiness and height of the tree), we get a tree which has the best approximation quality of the stochastic process in consideration. The multistage distance converges to 0 as the bushiness of the scenario tree increases. The convergence of the multistage distance holds in probability.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial5/#","page":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","title":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","text":"The table below shows the multistage distance of trees of different heights with an increasing branching structure:","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial5/#","page":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","title":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","text":"Branches Height = 1 Height = 2 Height = 3 Height = 4\n3 0.24866 0.2177 0.16245 0.11346\n4 0.16805 0.12861 0.08451 0.05236\n5 0.12333 0.08559 0.05073 0.0289\n6 0.09561 0.06042 0.03345 0.01913\n7 0.07752 0.04562 0.02333 0.01188\n8 0.06401 0.03547 0.01711 0.00855","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial5/#","page":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","title":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","text":"The above table can be represented in a plot as follows:","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial5/#","page":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","title":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","text":"(Image: Multistage distance for trees of different heights)","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial5/#","page":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","title":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","text":"The above plot can be obtained by calling the function bushinessNesDistance() from the package.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial5/#","page":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","title":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","text":"Generally, the approximating quality of a scenario tree increases with increasing height of the tree and increasing bushiness of the tree.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial5/#Comparison-with-implementation-in-MATLAB-1","page":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","title":"Comparison with implementation in MATLAB","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial5/#","page":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","title":"Performance of ScenTrees.jl","text":"In order to see how fast Julia is, we compared the run-time performance of different trees with different heights with the same algorithm written in MATLAB programming language.

In this package, we use a fixed number of trajectories of a stochastic process to generate and improve a scenario tree or a scenario lattice. The quality of approximation between the stochastic process and the scenario tree/scenario lattice is measured using a multistage(process) distance. The multistage distance suits well to measure the distance between stochastic processes because it takes notice of the effect of evolution of the process over time (cf. Georg Ch. Pflug and Alois Pichler(2012) for more on distances for multistage stochastic optimization models). The resulting scenario tree/lattice from the stochastic approximation process represents the stochastic process in the best possible way and so can be used for decision making process under uncertainty.\nWe also provide the user with one of the methods of generating trajectories from an array of data. This method takes two steps: First, we use the conditional density estimation to generate new but different samples based on the data given. Here we estimate the distribution of transitional densities given the history of the process via the non-parametric kernel distribution. Finally, we use the composition method to get a sample from the above distribution. The trajectory created in this process can then be used in the stochastic approximation algorithm to generate scenario trees or scenario lattices for multistage stochastic approximation. We urge the reader to have a look at Georg Ch. Pflug and Alois Pichler(2016), Georg Ch.
